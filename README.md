# APIs
This repository will hold my work on using different APIs.
I started with "how to access the sheets API from Goole.

What are API:
a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
 
 From Wikipedia:
 In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.
